    "\n",
    "2. Routing HTTP requests: Flask provides a simple way to route HTTP requests to different parts of the web scraping application. This can be useful for handling incoming URLs, processing data, and serving the results of the scraping process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Integrating with other tools: Flask can be easily integrated with other Python libraries and tools, such as Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium. This can allow developers to build more complex web scraping workflows that involve multiple tools and techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Deploying to the web: Flask can be used to deploy the web scraping application to a web server, making it accessible to users over the internet. This can be useful for sharing the results of the scraping process with others or for running the scraping process on a remote server."
